# NtUI Framework
### A modular and full client-side rendering framework for web ui development.

[This project is under development]

This framework is focused for web ui development without using node or third-party libraries.
It's fully coded in vanilla JS.

Basic capabilities:

* Render dynamic variables into HTML content without replacing all innerHTML content.
* Load external modules (JS files) for amplifyng framework features.
* Manage CSS from JS by converting CSS code into JSON format.

And more...

When first release come, i will work on a better readme.

[!] Due to compatibility issues between browsers, the framework's code doesn't contains any of ES6 syntax.
